# SpeakAloud

I am building it to use it for my English speaking practice tool and build my own word database.
Machine knows better. Why don’t I let the machine dictate my words to check my spells?
A simple shake gesture reset dictation for retrying. A series of works are grouped and for now locally saved.
What’s saved before shows up on the list, and let the machine read it for you.

## My ultimate goal
I’d like to study how to quantify one’s language skills.
My plan is to collect my words over decades so that I can discover patterns that define my language skills and use it to further study how to quantify it. I use it for my advantage to do some systematic approach to help improving a second language or my mother tongue for other people. Studying NLP or Pattern Recognition on my own is my other goals.
